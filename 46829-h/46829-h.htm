<h2>THE KAISER'S LOST CHANCE.</h2>

<p>I found him gazing intently at the framed Bill of Fare
by the main door of the Restaurant Furioso, where I had
often lunched at his table.</p>

<p>"Hullo, Fritz!" I exclaimed. "What are you doing out
here? Have you been sacked?"</p>

<p>"<span lang="de" xml:lang="de" title="Oh, Sir,">Ach, Mein Herr,</span>" he answered, "there has of the
German waiters what you call an up-round been. I prove
myself Swiss; I invoke the memory of <span class="smcap">Wilhelm Tell</span> and
the Alpine Club, but the proprietor say that he take no risk,
and out I go. But no matter. I myself was myself to
have sacked, but he spoke too quick."</p>

<p>I said I was sorry and asked whether he meant to go back
to Switzerland. Fritz winked and tapped his breast pocket.</p>

<p>"Perhaps," he said. "I am rich, I have money. But
first I buy new clothes and then I lunch at my own table
at the Furioso."</p>

<p>"Come where you can tell me all about it," said I, scenting
a story, and he led me to a quiet tavern in a back street.</p>

<p>"Beer," was his answer to my first question. "English
beer. I have done with Germany."</p>

<p>"I thought you said you were Swiss," I remarked.</p>

<p>"That is so," he replied; "but I have served Germany,
and, ach! she have the thankless tooth of the serpent's
child. I have read your <span class="smcap">Shakspeare</span>. But you shall know
all," he went on. "Already the police know all, and they
laugh in my face. They call me fool, but I have money,
and the <span class="smcap">Kaiser</span> has missed his chance.</p>

<p>"Listen, <span lang="de" xml:lang="de" title="Mister">Mein Herr</span>! I have been one of <span class="smcap">Steinhauer's</span>
spies. He is the Master Spy and came over to England
with the <span class="smcap">Kaiser</span>, and he stayed, I am told, at Buckingham
Palace. But <span class="smcap">Steinhauer</span> is a fool, and I tell him so in my
last letter. One day, a month ago, a gentleman dine at my
table: he speak good English and wear London clothes, but
I suspect him German, and when I see him eat I know.
Some English officers also dine in the room, and he look
at them&mdash;ach! as there were sour apples in his stomach.
So I speak in German to Hans at the next table, and, when
I give the bill, the gentleman point out a too-much charge
for the butter he have not; I bend my head to read, and
he whisper in my ear in German."</p>

<p>"Ah!" I said. "I can guess the next part about the
secret meeting and the false name and so on. But tell me
how the <span class="smcap">Kaiser</span> missed his chance."</p>

<p>"Well," he resumed, "I become a spy. My duty was
to listen to English officers who dine at the Furioso, and
to send reports to <span class="smcap">Steinhauer</span> through a cutter of hairs in
Soho, who call himself Ephraim Smiley, but his right name
is Johann Schnitzelbrod. One night three young officers
dine at my table and talk much about the British Army.
One say the Arsenal is weak, another that the Rangers
cannot shoot for nuts, and the third that the Palace is sure
to go down next Saturday. 'Aha!' I say to myself, 'the
Army is bad, and they fear Zeppelins or revolution.'
<span class="smcap">Steinhauer</span> will know which, and I shall get the five-pound
note. So I send my report; but <span class="smcap">Steinhauer</span> is
stupid and the five-pound note come not, and I say, 'Better
luck on the following occasion.'</p>

<p>"A week later a cavalry officer dine at my table alone,
and he talk to me for company. He ask me if I follow
horses, and I say, 'Yes, formerly, when they drew the bus.'
Then he laugh, and ask whether I ever have what he call
a flutter on a dead snip. I scratch my head, but Hans
interpret, and so, as you English say, I tumble. I tell
him I would like, but for me the dead snip have not yet
deceased. He say, 'Put all your tips on Mutton Chop for
the Cookingham Stakes,' and he give me a shilling. Presently
Hans tell me that Mutton Chop is not an English
food, but a horse. He say he know of what he call a
bookie who is not a Welshman, and if Mutton Chop win,
I multiply my savings one hundert times.</p>

<p>"So I write to <span class="smcap">Steinhauer</span> in haste: he must advise the
<span class="smcap">Kaiser</span> to put one hundred million marks on Mutton Chop,
and the war will be paid for and something left over for
poor Fritz. Then I take my savings from the bank and
pawn my clothes, and much money goes to the bookie to
back Mutton Chop. Well, the good Mutton Chop roll
home&mdash;that is what Hans call it, and he is a racing-instructed;
he has been waiter at Ascot, and once he go to
see the City and South London. The same day come a
letter from <span class="smcap">Steinhauer</span> that I am a <i lang="de" xml:lang="de" title="pig's head">Schweinkopf</i>, and he
shall advise the <span class="smcap">Kaiser</span> no such thing; and he dismiss me
with notting.</p>

<p>"But I go to the bookie, who laugh and pay me one
tausend pound. He did not care; he make ten tausend
from the many fools who back German Sausage. So I
write one last letter to <span class="smcap">Steinhauer</span> and say, '<i lang="de" xml:lang="de" title="pig's head">Schweinkopf</i>
yourself! Stew in your own <i>Sauerkraut</i>!' He get another
spy to denounce me, but I find the police have opened all
my letters, and they laugh in my face. But the superintendent
say, 'Much obliged, Herr Fritz! Thanks to you, I
also make my <i>bitchen</i> on Mutton Chop. When you get
another dead snip, pass it on.'"</p>

<p>Then I ordered Fritz another English beer, and gave
him an introduction to my own tailor.

<h2>CHARIVARIA.</h2>

<p>Germany, it is stated, has promised
to pay Turkey a fifth of the war
indemnity, when she gets it. This
looks as if she didn't expect to win.</p>

<p class="center"><sup>*</sup><sub>*</sub><sup>*</sup></p>

<p>At last, we hear, the enemy has
found a song which is becoming as
popular as "It's a long way to
Tipperary." We refer to "Stop your
nibbling, <span class="smcap">Joffre</span>."</p>

<p class="center"><sup>*</sup><sub>*</sub><sup>*</sup></p>

<p>The Sultan of <span class="smcap">Turkey</span> is reported
to be suffering from a severe heart
attack, and the <span class="smcap">Kaiser</span>, it is said, has
written to him telling him not to be
nervous, and pointing out how soon
he himself recovered after his heart
had bled for Louvain.</p>

<p class="center"><sup>*</sup><sub>*</sub><sup>*</sup></p>

<p>"There is no room in Germany
to-day for soft-hearted humanitarians,"
says <i lang="de" xml:lang="de" title="The Post">Die Post</i>. We had not suspected
that the Fatherland was inconveniently
crowded with this type.</p>

<p class="center"><sup>*</sup><sub>*</sub><sup>*</sup></p>

<p>The production of <i>King Albert's
Book</i> is said to have caused many
pangs of jealousy to the <span class="smcap">Kaiser</span>. He
must, however, have patience. His
army's achievements in Belgium are
now being investigated, and <i>Kaiser
Wilhelm's Book</i> will appear in due
course, and should also cause a sensation.</p>

<p class="center"><sup>*</sup><sub>*</sub><sup>*</sup></p>

<p>The Turkish Army despatched "to
deliver Egypt" has begun its march
to the Suez Canal, but the Egyptians
remain calm, being convinced that
there is no real danger of their being
delivered.</p>

<p class="center"><sup>*</sup><sub>*</sub><sup>*</sup></p>

<p>Discontent with their Government's
inaction increases among the Italians
day by day, and the Tiber has risen.</p>

<p class="center"><sup>*</sup><sub>*</sub><sup>*</sup></p>

<p>The report that the <span class="smcap">Emperor Francis
Joseph</span> is seriously ill is denied. As a
matter of fact our information is to the
effect that His Majesty has not yet been
told about the War, as it was feared
that it might worry the old gentleman.</p>

<p class="center"><sup>*</sup><sub>*</sub><sup>*</sup></p>

<p>On Christmas Eve a bomb was
planted by an enemy aeroplane in a
Dover garden. This must be a case of
intensive culture.</p>

<p class="center"><sup>*</sup><sub>*</sub><sup>*</sup></p>

<p>The Crown Prince of <span class="smcap">Germany</span> is
reported to have sent a special emissary
to this country in order to report
whether <i>The New Clown</i> at the New
Theatre is, as he suspects, a disrespectful
attack on His Royal Highness.</p>

<p class="center"><sup>*</sup><sub>*</sub><sup>*</sup></p>

<p>"The English," says the unspeakable
Dr. <span class="smcap">Karl Peters</span> in the <i lang="de" xml:lang="de" title="Munich Latest News">Münchener
Neueste Nachrichten</i>, "believe our
natural kindness to be mere weakness."
Certainly we have never looked upon
kindness as being their strong point.</p>

<p class="center"><sup>*</sup><sub>*</sub><sup>*</sup></p>

<p>It is announced from Berlin that the
Government intends to issue a new set
of stamps for use in Belgium. Germany
is evidently trying to attach to herself
the sympathy of philatelists&mdash;a class of
men well known for their adhesive
propensities.</p>

<p class="center"><sup>*</sup><sub>*</sub><sup>*</sup></p>

<h2>"TRADE WITH THE ENEMY FINE."</h2>

<p class="author"><i>Daily Mail.</i></p>

<p>We think it a mistake, not to say unpatriotic,
to praise illegal transactions
in this way.</p>

<p class="center"><sup>*</sup><sub>*</sub><sup>*</sup></p>

<p>In describing the wonderful escape
of the Newcastle express the other day
when the engine left the rails, <i>The
Evening Standard</i> reported that "The
passengers contained many soldiers
returning home on leave." While we
have realised that there might be a
danger of some of our heroes being
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
killed by kindness, this news frankly
shocks us, and we are sorry that it
should have been passed by the Censor.</p>

<p class="center"><sup>*</sup><sub>*</sub><sup>*</sup></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rudyard Kipling</span> entered his
fiftieth year last week. He did it
quietly, without an ode from the <span class="smcap">Poet
Laureate</span>.</p>

<p class="center"><sup>*</sup><sub>*</sub><sup>*</sup></p>

<p>The <i lang="de" xml:lang="de" title="Forward">Vorwärts</i> reports that there is a
shortage of braces among the German
soldiers at the Front. Ostend, evidently,
is not "so bracing" after all.</p>

<p class="center"><sup>*</sup><sub>*</sub><sup>*</sup></p>

<p>The Sultan of <span class="smcap">Turkey</span> has issued a
rescript announcing that the Sultan of
<span class="smcap">Egypt</span> will be tried by a court-martial
of the 4th Army Corps,
which is now operating against
Egypt. They were wrong who
alleged that the Turks are wanting
in humour.</p>

<p class="center"><sup>*</sup><sub>*</sub><sup>*</sup></p>

<p>The French Government has
prohibited the exportation of
butter. Curiously enough the
day after the prohibition our
provision merchant informed us
that he was quite unable to supply
us with our "real Devonshire
butter" as usual.</p>

<p class="center"><sup>*</sup><sub>*</sub><sup>*</sup></p>

<p>The latest recruiting poster
at Hastings runs:&mdash;</p>

<p>"FALL IN! SOUTHDOWNS." But this does not necessarily
mean cheaper mutton.</p>

<p class="center"><sup>*</sup><sub>*</sub><sup>*</sup></p>

<p>"Reuter's New York correspondent
wires that Mr. Eugene
Zimmerman, whose death was
announced the other day, was
the railway magnate, and not
the noted caricaturist popularly
known as 'Zim.'" This news,
when conveyed to the latter,
was very well received.</p>

<h2>PAYING GUESTS.</h2>

<p>I came across Crawshaw in the road
unexpectedly. I would rather meet a
rate-collector than Crawshaw. He is
the most dangerous beggar in England.
He could induce a blind crossing-sweeper
to guarantee half-a-crown a
week to a Belgian Relief Fund. If
only he were Chancellor of the Exchequer
people would almost like paying
income-tax.</p>

<p>"Good morning, old man," I said,
trying to dash past him.</p>

<p>"Just the man I was looking for,"
said Crawshaw. "I want you."</p>

<p>"My dear fellow," I began, "I can't
possibly afford&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I don't want your money," interrupted
Crawshaw.</p>

<p>"Well, you've got all my spare
blankets, underclothing and old novels."</p>

<p>"I want you to come to a little
dinner I'm giving on Monday. Just a
bachelor festival."</p>

<p>I looked at him suspiciously. "You
intend to entice me into your house and
produce a subscription list."</p>

<p>"My dear fellow, I'll do nothing of
the sort. It's just that I want a few
of my friends to have a good time.
Look in about 7.30. You'll come?
That's good."</p>

<p>I found a genial company assembled
when I arrived.</p>

<p>"Now we're all here," said Crawshaw.
"Come in to dinner, you men."</p>

<p>Two or three guests confided to me
on the way that Crawshaw owed us a
good dinner after all he had got out of
us. We seated ourselves at the table,
and then I noticed an empty bowl in
the middle. It bore this inscription,
"Any one desiring to make a remark
about the War will drop a shilling in
for the Soldiers' Comforts Fund."</p>

<p>"My idea," said our smiling host.
"We want a nice convivial dinner with
an evening off from The Subject.
We shall return to it to-morrow with
fresh intelligence and enthusiasm after
a brief relaxation."</p>

<p>I turned to my neighbour, Spoor, and
carefully selecting a safe topic
began on the weather. "Bit
windy, isn't it, to-night?"</p>

<p>"Good anti-Zeppelin weather,
I call it," said the incautious
Spoor.</p>

<p>"A shilling, please, Spoor,"
remarked Crawshaw.</p>

<p>Rogers was across the table.
I could see him fiddling with
knives and salt-cellars. All at
once he broke out: "In our
platoon to-day there was a man
missing, and in consequence a
blank file. Now in such a
case&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You pay a shilling," interposed
Crawshaw.</p>

<p>For a moment an awful
silence prevailed. I could think
of nothing except the War. All
at once Williams threw a five-shilling
piece into the bowl.</p>

<p>"I met an officer on leave
from the Front to-day," he
began, "and he was telling me
just what <span class="smcap">Joffre</span> is up to."</p>

<p>Now Chapman is nothing if
not a strategist. He listened
with impatience to the exposition
of <span class="smcap">Joffre's</span> idea, and then,
hurling half-a-sovereign into
the bowl, proved conclusively that
Williams' informant was absolutely in
the wrong.</p>

<p>It was at this point that I remembered
an interesting fact I had just
heard about Italy's mobilisation. I
could not keep it back. "Crawshaw,"
I appealed, "will you compromise?
A sovereign each for the dinner?"</p>

<p>"Done," said Crawshaw.</p>

<p>"Good. I always mistrusted you.
I came without a penny. Lend me a
sovereign."</p>

<p>"I'm not in this compromise," cried
Chapman. "I've said all I've got to
say. You'll run me in for nothing
more."</p>

<p>It was at the end of the meal that
Crawshaw rose. "Thanks awfully, you
fellows. There's twelve pounds twelve
in the bowl. Eleven of us have given
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
a sovereign and Chapman there, bless
his generous heart, thirty-two shillings."</p>

<p>"Crawshaw," grumbled Chapman, "I
know you've a family. I know you're
too old. I know you're physically
disqualified. But you ought to go to
the Front. Not only would it raise the
spirits of the poor people you leave
behind here, but your very presence in
the trench with a subscription list
would make the enemy run."</p>

<h2>THE REASON.</h2>

<p>He was a saturnine-looking man
with a distinctly anti-social suggestion;
but after a while he began to talk. We
discussed one thing and another, and
casually he remarked that he was connected
with the motor industry&mdash;as
indeed all men whom one cannot
immediately place now are.</p>

<p>He did not build cars, he said, or
design them, or sell them. What then
did he do?</p>

<p>"My task is a peculiar one," he said,
"and you might never guess it. It is
wholly concerned with taxi-cabs. I am
an inspector of taxi-cab windows."</p>

<p>He looked at me as with a challenge.</p>

<p>"It is your duty," I inquired, with a
horrible feeling that I could not congratulate
him on his efficiency, "to
inspect the windows and see that they
are in good order?"</p>

<p>"To inspect the windows&mdash;yes," he
replied; "but not for the purpose you
name."</p>

<p>"Then why inspect them?" I asked
warmly. "What is wanted is some one
to see that the wretched things can
be manipulated. I would bet that
out of every ten cabs I am in not
more than two have windows that will
work."</p>

<p>"Two!" he mused. "That's a very
high percentage. I must see to that."</p>

<p>"High!" I exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Yes, high," he repeated. "You
see, my duty is to visit the garages all
over London before the cabs go out
and see that the windows won't work.
If they do work I disarrange them.
That's my job."</p>

<p>"But why?" I gasped.</p>

<p>"Haven't you noticed how much
worse they have been lately, and that,
when you take a cab off the rank, the
windows are always down when you
get in, however bad the weather?"</p>

<p>"Yes," I said, "Everyone must
have noticed it."</p>

<p>"Well," he continued, "that's my
doing. That's my job."</p>

<p>"But why?" I repeated.</p>

<p>"Just a part of the general scheme
of getting the War into people's minds,"
he said. "The darkening of London,
the closing of the public-houses, the
defective cab windows&mdash;they're all of
a piece. Only the cab-window trick is
the most useful."</p>

<p>"How?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Well, it hardens you," he said.
"It accustoms you to cold and wet,
and that's all to the good."</p>

<p>So now I know.</p>

<h2>ELEVEN SECONDS.</h2>

<p>The word "schedule" always bothers
me; when I see it on an income-tax
paper I lose my head. In my confusion
I sign my name lavishly. I
confess to profits from trades, professions,
employments <i>and</i> vocations;
I reveal the presence of unsuspected
gas-works, quarries, salt-springs, alum
mines, streams of water, ferries,
cemeteries and "other concerns of the
like nature within the United Kingdom";
no secret is made of my colonial
and foreign possessions. Wherever I
see an inviting gap I slip in a few
figures.... Then the assessor looks at
my paper and tells me what I ought to
give him.</p>

<p>This year things went worse than
ever. I got some noughts in the wrong
place; a whole lot of gaps headed
"Claim for Relief in Respect of Earned
Income," which I had supplied with
particular liberality, went by the board,
all because I hadn't noticed in the preambulation
some foolish date "before
which any claim must be preferred."
Those two accidents practically doubled
my little tax ... and then <span class="smcap">Lloyd
George</span> went and doubled it again. It
began to look as if it would be cheaper
to pay income on my income-tax instead
of the other way round.</p>

<p>"Celia," I said, "we're ruined.
Cancel any orders for potted salmon;
we shall have to live simply in future."
And I told her just what the tax-gatherer
had asked for.</p>

<p>"But why do we have to pay so
much?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Partly because of the <span class="smcap">Kaiser</span>, and
partly because of me. History will
apportion the blame."</p>

<p>Celia seemed prepared to anticipate
History.</p>

<p>"Don't forget," I went on hastily,
"that the money will be well spent.
If I had to make a fool of myself, I
would sooner have done it this year
than any other. It is a privilege to
pay for a war like this."</p>

<p>Celia looked thoughtful.</p>

<p>"How much does the war cost
England?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, lots. I think it mentioned
the exact figures in <i>The Times</i> this
morning. They'll be only too glad of
my little contribution."</p>

<p>She retired in search of <i>The Times</i>.</p>

<hr />

<p>The stars denote Celia at work. I
can imagine her with her head on one
side and the tip of her tongue just
peering out to see how she is getting
on, the paper in front of her a mass of
figures. The ink is creeping up her
pen; her forefinger is nervous and bids
her hurry.</p>

<p>She has finished, and she comes into
the room, trying to look grave. My letter
to the Assessor, "Sir and Friend,&mdash;By
the beard (if any) of your ancestor, I
beseech you&mdash;&mdash;" is abandoned, and I
turn to her.</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"I've worked it out," she said. "Do
you know how long you'll be paying
for the war?"</p>

<p>"Oh, quite a long time."</p>

<p>"Eleven seconds."</p>

<p>It was a little disappointing.</p>

<p>"Eleven seconds," repeated Celia.
"One&mdash;two&mdash;three&mdash;four&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's too fast. Begin again."</p>

<p>"One&mdash;&mdash;two&mdash;&mdash;three&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's better."</p>

<p>She counted eleven. It seemed
much longer now. One&mdash;&mdash;two&mdash;&mdash;
three&mdash;&mdash;four....</p>

<p>And all the time my brave army was
fighting in Flanders, my navy was
sweeping the North Sea, my million
recruits were growing into soldiers.
In Yorkshire my looms were busy,
<span class="smcap">Armstrong's</span> were turning out my
guns, Northampton was giving my
gallant boys their boots. Did an aeroplane
shoot up into the sky, did a
submarine dive into the deep, mine
was the supporting hand. Was I not
a god among men?</p>

<p>"Ten," said Celia&mdash;"eleven. What
are you thinking about?"</p>

<p>I pitched my letter to the Assessor
in the fire.</p>

<p>"I've been thinking about my war,"
I said. "Every shot that was fired while
you were counting I paid for; I paid
for the food of every soldier and sailor;
for the separation allowances of their
wives; for hospitals and ambulances and
doctors."</p>

<p>"How lovely it sounds. I hadn't
thought of it like that. It makes eleven
seconds seem an age."</p>

<p>"It is an age. For eleven seconds
<span class="smcap">French</span> and <span class="smcap">Jellicoe</span> were my men."</p>

<p>"Then I think you might have
warned me," said Celia reproachfully,
"so that we could have shared them."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry," I said. Then I had
an idea. "It's all right," I said. "I
made a mistake. Those weren't our
eleven seconds at all; <span class="smcap">Carnegie</span> or
somebody paid for those. We'll have
ours together later on."</p>

<p>"Well, let's see that they are good
ones ... when we're having a victory.
We might tell people that the last
eleven seconds off the Falkland Islands
were ours."</p>

<p>"But I hadn't paid then. Anyway,
I don't think they begin to use my
money till April 5th ... I say, Celia,
let's do our eleven seconds in style.
Let's make an occasion of it."</p>

<p>"Oh, do let's." She looked at her
diary. "What about April 15th? I'm
not doing anything then."</p>

<p>"But why the 15th?"</p>

<p>"I thought perhaps the <span class="smcap">King</span> might
like the first few days for himself.
Or doesn't he pay income-tax? Anyhow,
the 15th is a Thursday, which is
a nice day."</p>

<p>So we have decided on Thursday,
April 15th. Starting at 1.30 (because
we want to pay for as much bully beef
and jam as possible), for eleven seconds
we shall support alone the British
Empire.... And, when those fateful
moments are over, then we shall raise
a glass in gratitude to the men who
have served us so well.</p>

<hr />

<p>Oh, you lucky millionaires, who may
be gods, perhaps, for half-an-hour&mdash;have
you filled in your income-tax
forms? If not, fill them in properly
this time. Leave out no quarry, no
alum mine, no stream of water. Who
knows? That salt spring which you
were forgetting may well be the deciding
second of the war.</p>

<h2>FROM THE BACK OF THE FRONT.</h2>

<p class="author"><i>Somewhere in &mdash;&mdash;.</i></p>

<p>Active service is like oratory in that
one of its biggest ideas is action. Being
ostensibly on active service ourselves
we felt we ought to see a little before
going home; and now we have. We
make no boast about it. Like the
simple English soldiers we are we
merely state the fact for what it is
worth.</p>

<p>You ask, you who lead the sheltered
life, what we felt like under fire; how
you swim from one trench to another;
what we ate and drank; and what a
bayonet charge is really like. Let me
answer your questions one by one.</p>

<p>(1) We were such a long way under
fire that some doubt existed as to whether
the Germans were merely trying to
frighten us, or were engaged in testing
new rifles and fired high and in no
particular direction for fear of hitting
somebody. We only had one casualty
and he wanted to walk across to the
German trenches and insist on an
apology and a new pair of boots, the
right heel being practically torn off.
But we convinced him that it was
futile for an Englishman to argue with
Germans, especially when ignorant of
their language. If a German has made
up his mind to be careless nothing will
stop him. To return to the question,
we didn't feel under fire at all.</p>

<p>(2) You aren't allowed to leave a
trench; and a man who was allowed to
and then went to another shouldn't be
allowed out at all.</p>

<p>(3) The soldier is not particular about
his "tack"&mdash;as he calls his food.
Bacon and eggs, sausages, chicken,
washed down with hot coffee, are good
enough for him to fight on. Failing
even such humble comestibles he will,
when pressed by hunger, open a tin of
bully beef and decide he is not hungry
after all.</p>

<p>(4) Bayonet charges are getting rather
cheap, so we didn't have one.</p>

<p>We were opposed to the flower of the
German army, the <span class="smcap">Kaiser's</span> beloved
Prussians. This we were told on our
arrival. Next day we learned that a
prisoner taken turned out to be one of
the <span class="smcap">Kaiser's</span> beloved Bavarians. We
subsequently discovered&mdash;well, to save
time you might just take a map of the
German Empire and pick where you like.</p>

<p>If anyone tells you that our heroes
live in trenches like tessellated boudoirs
in an atmosphere of sybaritic luxury
you might just put him right. Our
Edward had got hold of some such
idea from diagrams in the illustrated
papers. When we reached the crumbling
ruins we were to defend, an officer
was so impressed by Edward's air
of woebegone disgust that he observed
brusquely that, in the trenches,
comfort was a matter of minor importance.</p>

<p>This assurance pulled Edward
together for the moment; and he had
just settled down to a placid expectation
of the evening meal when we
learned that our commissariat had
stuck in the mud some miles back.
However, as a second officer cheerfully
observed, in the trenches food is a
matter of minor importance. Edward,
who had pinned all his faith on the
commissariat, relapsed into a resigned
melancholy.</p>

<p>Just as he was making his poor but
ingenious preparations for slumber in a
dug-out that looked like a badly drained
pond a third officer came along. A
digging fatigue was wanted for the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
night. We were it. Edward moaned,
not mutinously, you understand, but
expressively. The third officer turned
on him sharply. "In the trenches,"
he observed epigrammatically, "sleep
is a matter of minor importance."</p>

<p>Edward and I returned at 3 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>
As he flopped wearily down I heard
him murmur judicially: "In the
trenches soldiers are matters of minor
importance."</p>

<p>Edward never got really fond of the
trenches.</p>

<h2>A FIELD SERVICE POSTCARD.</h2>

<p>Dear <i>Mr. Punch</i>,&mdash;Hurrah! I am
so excited and my paw shakes so that
I have to use my teeth to keep the pen
steady. My mistress has received a
letter from my master at the Front&mdash;at
least it isn't a letter but a postcard.
I know it's from him because she gave
it to me to smell, and I nearly swallowed
it in my anxiety to make quite sure.
I should have got a beating for my
foolish behaviour, but luckily my mistress
was crying at the time and could
not see what I was doing. When we
were both calmer she told me what
was on the card; and there was nothing
whatever about me! My master merely
said that he was quite well. I kept
my ears cocked for some time waiting
for more, but that was all.</p>

<p>I need hardly tell you, <i>Mr. Punch</i>,
how disappointed I felt. It is true
there was nothing about my mistress
either, but she was so happy she didn't
seem to mind. I could not understand
it. And then I suddenly remembered
something I had heard from a dog who
had actually been out at the Front
taking care of his regiment. He told
me that Lord <span class="smcap">Kitchener</span> had invented
a special postcard for the use of soldiers
out there. They are not allowed to
write anything on these cards except
their names, but there are several
sentences printed on them and the
sentences that are not suitable are
struck out by the soldiers. My master
had evidently found them all unsuitable
except the one that said he was quite
well.</p>

<p>Now I readily admit that these postcards
are an excellent idea of Lord
<span class="smcap">Kitchener's</span>, but I do not think that
he has carried out the scheme as thoroughly
as he should. Where would
be the harm in putting at the end of
the card, "Give my love and a bone
to &mdash;&mdash;"? It would only take up
one line and would mean such a lot
to us. I expect the truth is Lord
<span class="smcap">Kitchener</span> has not got a dog of his
own, so the point did not occur to
him, and it merely needs a hint from
you, <i>Mr. Punch</i>, to get the matter put
right. I only hope he won't be
annoyed when he finds what a slip
he has made.</p>

<p class="author">
Yours expectantly,<br />
<span class="smcap">A Sad Dog</span>.</p>

<p>P.S.&mdash;Perhaps you had better not
publish this as it rather shows him up,
and I should not like to think that I
had made people lose confidence in
him.</p>

<h2>THE DEFENCE OF AMBERRY PARVA.</h2>

<p>Amberry Parva certainly existed
before <span class="smcap">Shakspeare</span>'s time, but I doubt
if <span class="smcap">Shakspeare</span> ever saw it. For which
he was so much the poorer, seeing
that Amberry is a faithful microcosm of
much of England.</p>

<p>Thomas Fallow, Aaron West and
George Hangar are all friends of mine.
Though still comparative youthful,
they are the shining lights of the
Amberry Rural Council, self-trained to
face a crisis or an emergency with calm
and steady bearing. When I came
upon them last week they were seated
about the bench outside the door of
"The Three Cups." A fourth man&mdash;a
small hairy stranger&mdash;was addressing
them.</p>

<p>Thomas Fallow motioned me to
halt.</p>

<p>"We're consultin'," he explained,
"with Mr. Chittenden as keeps the
baccy-shop in Wream."</p>

<p>Now Wream is a shade&mdash;the merest
shade&mdash;more important (in its own
esteem) than Amberry. It sits astride
the same high road that the Romans
carved seawards a thousand-odd years
ago, and supplies us with newspapers,
telegrams and gossip. While we score
in the possession of two tin chapels to
their one, we writhe inwardly over a
Diamond Jubilee Fountain which we
cannot hope to surpass.</p>

<p>"Mr. Chittenden," pursued Thomas,
"brings noos."</p>

<p>"Good news?" I asked.</p>

<p>Mr. Chittenden, like the Eldest Oyster,
shook his heavy head.</p>

<p>"I 'eard it from a natteralized German
two days ago. It seems that they're
goin' to make a fresh dash with invisible
Zeppelins. Once they can
<i>e</i>-vade the ships that's watchin'&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He left the sentence unfinished.</p>

<p>"Consequence o' which," said George
Hangar, "we've gone an' made ourselves
into an Informal Committee o'
Defence, same as sits night an' day in
the War Office in London. An' the
question before the meetin' is, what's
to be done if some fine day we wakes
up to find a couple o' thousand black
'elmets marchin' down the main road?"</p>

<p>"Ambush 'em," said Thomas Fallow
definitely. "Told you so afore. Lie
be'ind the 'edges an' pick 'em off. My
old rook-rifle'd roll 'em over proper.
Shoot straight an' keep on shootin'."</p>

<p>Aaron made a scornful noise in his
throat.</p>

<p>"An' them as did get in the village'd
punish us for them as didn't! Burnin',
killin' an' worse."</p>

<p>"Then outflank 'em," insisted Thomas
doggedly. "Let 'em 'ave their fill of
advancin', same as old Joffer done, an'
then ketch 'em in the side an' discriminate
'em."</p>

<p>"You're not agoin' to do that with
the men left in Amberry," said Aaron.
He was a market-gardener by trade.
"'Twould be like a dozen sparrers
tryin' to outflank a steam-roller.
Trenchin's the thing. Dig deep, an'
lay the soil loose 'long the far edge.
There's a decent bit o' shelter by
Whemmick's Cottages."</p>

<p>"The best bein' opposite Number
Five," added Fallow, whereat there
was a bellow of laughter, and Aaron
flushed magnificently, for at Number
Five lives Molly Garner, wooed by
Aaron, but as yet hesitating between
him and the Wream plumber.</p>

<p>George Hangar, who up to the present
had scarcely spoken, intervened.
He has a bass voice, which on Sundays
makes the little roof of the United
Bunyans quiver; for the other six days
of the week he works at a carpenter's
bench in an open-fronted shed. He
has a sound knowledge of timber, and
is no ignoramus concerning the values
of Hepplewhite and Sheraton.</p>

<p>"You're wrong," he roared. "Silly-minded
an' wrong! This ain't the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
Aisne. What do a village do when it's
attacked? Answer me that."</p>

<p>No one answered; to say the wrong
thing would exasperate him, to say the
right would exasperate him still more.</p>

<p>"They puts up barrycades," continued
Hangar. "An' for why? 'Cause
it's only them that can hold off horse,
foot an' 'tillery. Barrycades made o'
seasoned oak, same as I got stored at
the back o' my shed, sunk a good two
feet, with bolted cross-pieces an' spurs,
an' maybe a trifle o' barbed wire in
front."</p>

<p>"An' where's this contraption
to be set up?"
demanded Mr. Chittenden
with sudden suspicion.</p>

<p>"End o' village."</p>

<p>"Meanin' that the enemy
may march through Wream,
with nothin' to stop 'em
wreckin' the Fountain? An'
this was to be a meetin' for
the consideration o' mutual
defence!"</p>

<p>"The question afore the
members," said Aaron hastily,
"is, which place 'as most
strategetical value? Thing
is to stop 'em quick an' for
good."</p>

<p>"An' where'll you beat a
rook-rifle for doin' that?"
demanded Thomas Fallow.
"If I'm willin' to take the
risks&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"'Tain't a question o'
willingness, but tatties," said
Mr. Chittenden, still unappeased.</p>

<p>"Then put the case afore
the sergeant as is stayin' at
the police-station," said
George.</p>

<p>There was a moment's
pause, then Aaron spoke.</p>

<p>"The motion is carried,"
he said, "an' the meetin'
stands adjourned <i>sinny die</i>."</p>

<hr />

<p>I did not meet any of the members
for several days afterwards; then chance
took me in the direction of George
Hangar's workshop. I found him engrossed
in the unheard-of task of
arranging and packing his tools.</p>

<p>"Well?" I asked.</p>

<p>He rasped his chin pensively with a
chisel.</p>

<p>"Did the interview with the Sergeant
take place?"</p>

<p>"Ay; the feller's more brains than
the rest of us put together. Reckon
it's trainin'."</p>

<p>"What happened?"</p>

<p>"What 'appened? 'If you barrycades,
entrenches, enfilades or outflanks
'em outside Amberry,' says 'e, 'the
enemy'll wait for reinforcements, an'
then smash you with bigger guns.
'Twill be the same at Wream, Bewchester,
Lydhirst, Lower Thettley, an'
Capper'am.'"</p>

<p>"Which brings us to the sea?"</p>

<p>"Ezzackly."</p>

<p>"Where it's the Fleet's job."</p>

<p>"'Twould seem so. But, as the Sergeant
pointed out, the Germans is by
birth an' natur' land-fighters, an' must
so be met, trained man to trained man.
Meaning Territorials."</p>

<p>"Then your plans came to nothing?"</p>

<p>"Only in a manner o' speakin', Sir.
In fact, the resolution put afore the
meetin' would 'a' been carried <i>nem. con.</i>
but for the unsatisfactoriness o' Jacob
Chittenden's chest-measurement. As
it is, 'e's eatin' b'iled bread an' practising
three hours a day on the horizontal-bar."</p>

<p>I was a little bewildered.</p>

<p>"What resolution?"</p>

<p>He took a paper from his apron
pocket and read as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>That it be 'ereby decided, in the
joint int'rests of Wheam, Amberry Parva,
Great Britain and 'is Majesty's Dominions
beyond the Seas, that the undersigned,
bein' between the age limits,
sound in wind an' limb, an' not needed
at 'ome as much as they thought they
was, do 'ereby join the Territorial Army
at the earliest possible date. <span class="smcap">Thomas
Fallow</span>, <span class="smcap">Aaron West</span>, <span class="smcap">Geo. Hangar</span>.

<h2>THE SCAPEGOAT.</h2>

<p>"And what do you do with yourself
on your half-holidays?"</p>

<p>I had taken courage to
address the office-boy who
keeps his eye on me while
I wait humbly in the vestibule
of my Financial Adviser.</p>

<p>"Pitchers," he replied
affably.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon," I
said.</p>

<p>"Movin' pitchers," he explained;
and I knew that
the cinema had another slave.</p>

<p>And this too I knew, that
a youth who breathed, as he
did, the pure atmosphere of
High Finance, would never
commit a crime and blame
the pitchers for it, as so many
of our young criminals do.
So many, in fact, that in my
mind's eye I see the following
reports in the papers:&mdash;</p>

<p>A boy of five was brought
yesterday before the Darlington
Bench charged with the
bombardment of a street.
Evidence showed that the
prisoner established a machine-gun
in the back garden
of his father's house and systematically
fired it at his
neighbours' walls, doing considerable
damage. The boy
pleaded guilty, but explained
that he had been to see some
war-pictures at the cinema.
The magistrate ordered the cinema to
be kept under observation, and awarded
the boy a shilling from the poor-box.</p>

<p>A girl of eight was charged at the
Guildhall with causing an obstruction.
Evidence was to the effect that she
stood in the middle of Cheapside holding
out her hands and a block resulted
which disorganised the traffic for some
hours. The child's excuse was that
she had been witnessing the Lord
Mayor's Show at the cinema.</p>

<p>"The pictures again!" exclaimed
the magistrate. "When will this
nuisance be stopped?"</p>

<p>Two boys of seven were charged at
the Thames Police Court yesterday
with kidnapping a young lady. Evidence
showed that on the evening
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
before, they first obtained possession
of a motor car from the window of a
shop in Long Acre, drove it at a
great pace (one constable said forty
miles an hour, and another sixty-one)
to a house in Park Lane, where, while
one boy remained outside, the other
drew a revolver and forced the resident
heiress into the car. At this point
they were arrested. The boys said
that they were very sorry, but that the
spectacle of an abduction romance on
the films had been too strong for them.</p>

<p>The magistrate: "What is the cinema
censor about? Nothing is more deplorable
than that the imaginations of
young boys should be excited by
these lurid dramas." The boys were
discharged.</p>

<p>Three boys of six, seven and eight
respectively were charged at Sheffield
with stealing a railway train. It appears
that while the driver of a Scotch excursion,
which was in a siding, was
oiling the wheels, the three boys sprang
to the footboard and started the train.
The driver pursued it, but was at once
shot by one of the boys, who was
armed to the teeth with pea-shooters.
Asked to explain their conduct the boys
said that they had seen so many train
robberies on the local cinemas that they
felt bound to do something in that line
themselves. The magistrate said he
did not wonder, and directed that the
proprietors of the cinemas should have
their licence cancelled.</p>

<p>Three men of criminal appearance,
against whom previous convictions
were proved, who were charged at Vine
Street with pocket picking, explained
that it was entirely due to the effect
produced upon them by <i>Oliver Twist</i>
on the cinema. The magistrate dismissed
the prisoners and ordered the
cinema to be closed.</p>

<h2>FURTHER NOTES BY A WAR-DOG.</h2>

<p>My name's "Scottie." I'm a collie
and wear a box in which I collect
contributions for the National Relief
Fund. Probably you've met me&mdash;and,
I hope, contributed. Not long ago, so
Mabel told a friend the other day, a
few of my early experiences were published
in a book called <i>Punch</i>. I've
had heaps more since then. I'm getting
quite an old hand at the piteous
"Won't-you-spare-me-something?"
look. For one thing, I've learnt to let
people put <i>anything</i> into my box. Once
I got a penny (from a little girl) that
turned out, when the box was opened,
to be chocolate. A bit cocoa-y by then,
but still eatable. But my best haul
was during my&mdash;and Mabel's&mdash;weekend
by the sea.</p>

<p>We went down in a corridor train,
where I collected quite a lot of money.
When the train stopped half-way there,
I jumped out for a mouthful of air,
and there, on the platform, was a black
retriever wearing a collecting box like
mine! I asked him what he meant by
it, and, as he didn't explain himself, I
went for him, and stood him upside
down; and in the scrimmage half a
crown fell out of his collecting box.
Everybody thought that it had fallen
out of mine; Mabel was <i>sure</i> it had;
so it was given to me. You should
have seen that retriever when I smiled
at him from the carriage window.</p>

<p>We reached the sea at last. The
Serpentine's a puddle by comparison.
The very first morning I tore across
the shingle with two two-shilling pieces
in my box rattling like eighteen-pence
in copper. Such a time I had, though
my box was dreadfully heavy, being
full of sand and sea water. Presently,
joy! the bottom fell out. But the
public later seemed quite satisfied,
until a horrid nurse-girl gave the show
away&mdash;and of course Mabel had it
mended.</p>

<p>The very day we came away I met
the millionaire man. It was a wild
wet day, and I was draining in an
alcove underneath the promenade when
he appeared. He didn't look rich,
and he was running and panting and
glancing over his shoulder in a hunted
manner. No sooner did he see me than
he whispered, "Blimy, 'ere's a chance!
Good dawg, then&mdash;'old yer 'ed up," and
at once crammed a heap of "goblins"
(Mabel's word) and lots of crackley
paper into my box. He followed this
up with about two yards of shiny chain
and things that winked so that I had
to wink as well. Then came lots of
things like goblins with their middles
bitten out; and hardly had he given
me the last before two monstrous men
in blue rushed round the corner. I
don't remember exactly what happened,
but the millionaire man said, Blimy,
couldn't he run after his hat wot the
wind blown off? and the blue men
said why, yes he could, but they were
sure he hadn't. Then <i>he</i> said, Blimy,
they could "turn him over," straight
they could, and <i>they</i> said straight they
would. But they didn't. Instead they
felt in all his pockets, and only found
a clay pipe and some cheese wrapped
up in newspaper. Then things became
so uninteresting that I sauntered
back to Mabel.</p>

<p>The day after our home-coming my
box and I were marched to the committee.
I've had some bad times there,
but nothing quite so bad before. The
way an old girl gushed about the
"darlings" (whoever they were) parting
with their jewellery simply wearied
me. As soon as Mabel felt strong
enough to walk we went home. She
seemed to forget that the haul was
entirely due to me. Yet she's a wonderful
memory for some things. Ever
since breakfast to-day she's done nothing
but talk about a daring robbery
at Winklebeach, and looks at me in the
most extraordinary manner. I don't
know what Winklebeach may be, but
it's as clear as daylight that she's
thinking of the six sweet biscuits that
I stole behind her back at her last "At
home." But how did she find out?</p>

<hr />

<h2>OUR FIRST CAPTURE.</h2>

<p class="center">By <span class="smcap">Special Constable XXX</span>.</p>

<p>You must understand that the work
of the Special Constable is so utterly
dreary that we heave sighs of envy on
seeing one of our number, an L.C.C.
employee, being allowed to clean the
windows of a public building. The
lucky dog!</p>

<p>Imagine, therefore, our joy at receiving
a staff order to watch out for
motor-cars with hoggish headlights,
and report their numbers to headquarters.
We were not to arrest them&mdash;even
if we could.</p>

<p>Within half an hour of the staff
order we registered Our First Capture.
Myself, I received a fleeting impression
of LL&mdash;8183; my colleague took it for
LS&mdash;6163. An amicable discussion
ensued. I pointed out that LS might
mean London Scottish, who should be
allowed to go scot free; he countered
with the suggestion that LL might
stand for <span class="smcap">Lloyd George</span>, who should
also be above the law. We tossed for
it. I won. The honour fell to me to
report the capture.</p>

<p>"Sergeant, oblige me by recording
the following episode in your official
notebook: Special Constable XXX
has the honour to report that on or
about the 15th instant, in the year of
grace&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Is there much more like this?"</p>

<p>"Don't rob me of my hour of glory.
I've had four blank months.... In
the year of grace 1914, at the hour of
5.15, post meridian, at the corner of
---- Street, a motor-car contravening,
traversing or otherwise infringing His
Majesty's Regulations promulgated by
the Secretary of State for Home
Affairs, pursuant to an Order in
Council&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What was its number?" demanded
the Sergeant crudely.</p>

<p>"LL&mdash;8183, Sir. And I have the
honour to suspect that it belonged to
the Right Hon. <span class="smcap">David Lloyd George</span>."</p>

<p>The Sergeant, who wears a yellow
brassard, reported to the Sub-Inspector
(red band), and from there the information
will travel upwards and onwards
to the Chief Sub-Inspector (light-blue
band), the Inspector (dark-blue band),
the Commander (white band), and
the Chief Staff Officer, who resides
in the west wing of New Scotland
Yard and probably wears a cocked hat.
From there it will cross the Bridge of
Sighs to the east wing, occupied by the
more ordinary police, and will trickle
down in reverse order of precedence to
a regular Constable, who will probably
call on Mr. <span class="smcap">Lloyd George</span> with an
official blue paper in his hand:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Sir,&mdash;From information received, it
transpires that on or about the 15th
instant, in the year of grace 1914, ...
head-lights contravening, traversing or
otherwise infringing ... and should
the offence be repeated.... In the
name of our Sovereign Lord the King,
Emperor of India, Defender of the
Faith."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lloyd George</span> will humbly submit
to the decree, will sign a promissory
note of obedience (Moratorium barred),
and the incident will close.</p>

<p>Think of the glory of putting all that
in motion!</p>

<p>Yes, it was worth while joining the
Force.</p>

<hr />

<p>It having been officially announced
(in "Charivaria") that members of the
O.B.C. (Old Boys Corps) object to being
called the Old B.C.'s, an intolerable suggestion
is now put forward that they
should be known as the "Obese He's."</p>

<hr />

<p>Rear-Admiral <span class="smcap">Schlieper</span> says in the
<i lang="de" xml:lang="de" title="Berlin Free Paper">Berliner Lokal-Anzeiger</i> that the Germans
could never overcome a certain
sentimental feeling of justice and delicacy
with regard to England. We do
not know how Scarborough regards
this veracious statement, but our own
motto is "Let Schlieping dogs lie."

<h2>AT THE PLAY.</h2>

<p class="center">"<span class="smcap">David Copperfield.</span>"</p>

<p>If it were a simple question of bulk,
few authors would lend themselves to
the process of compression so well as
<span class="smcap">Charles Dickens</span>; but the scheme of
<i>David Copperfield</i> is too complex, and
its interests too many and competitive,
to be packed into a three-hours' play,
even by Mr. <span class="smcap">Louis Parker</span>, master of
the tabloid. Of the main themes&mdash;the
career of the hero himself, the machinations
of <i>Uriah Heep</i>, the tragedy of
<i>Little Em'ly</i>&mdash;only the last was at all
effective in pillule form. The figure of
<i>David Copperfield</i>&mdash;always pleasant if
rather colourless&mdash;served to hold the
play together; but the central experience
of his life was treated with the
extreme of haziness. We were informed
of his engagement to <i>Dora</i>, his marriage,
her illness, her death, all with the
brevity of a French official <i>communiqué</i>;
but as for the child-wife herself we never
so much as set eyes on her. While
again we gathered that the designs of
<i>Uriah Heep</i> were ultimately confounded,
nobody without the aid of
memory or imagination could possibly
have penetrated their obscurity.</p>

<p>On the other hand&mdash;whether with or
without the connivance of Sir <span class="smcap">Herbert
Tree</span> I dare not conjecture&mdash;the person
of <i>Wilkins Micawber</i> was given a prominence
out of all proportion to his share
in any one of the plots. Unlike the
something that was to make his fortune,
he was always "turning up," and,
whenever he did, he practically had
the stage to himself.</p>

<p>I am far from quarrelling with this
arrangement, for I have never seen
Sir <span class="smcap">Herbert</span> in better form. His
humour was of the richest, yet full of
quiet subtleties, and merely to gaze
upon his grotesque figure was a pure
delight. That he should have permitted
himself, in a spirit of creative
irresponsibility, to deviate at times
into the borderland of farce, and become
an hilarious blend of himself and
Mr. <span class="smcap">Henry James</span> (I don't know why
he suggested to me a burlesque of Mr.
<span class="smcap">Henry James</span>, for I have never known
that most distinguished of writers to
lapse from decorum) need not trouble
anybody in a play where there was no
pretence of insisting upon the letter of
<span class="smcap">Dickens</span>.</p>

<p>The transition from <i>Falstaff</i> to
<i>Micawber</i>, from a bibber of sack to a
bibber of punch, was an easy one for
Sir <span class="smcap">Herbert</span>; but not so easy were the
constant changes from and into the part
of <i>Dan'l Peggotty</i>. Here he gave us a
really admirable character-sketch&mdash;for
<i>Peggotty</i> belongs to the region of possibility,
whereas <i>Micawber</i> is always a
creature of incredible fancy&mdash;and I am
not sure that his achievement as the old
salt was not, for him, the greater of the
two. Certainly in the scene where he
tells of his search over the world for
<i>Little Em'ly</i> he came nearer to simple
pathos than I have ever known him to
come. Even the strong Somerset accent
of this East Anglian tar could not
conceal his sincerity.</p>

<p>I shrink from the odious task of distinguishing
between the merits of a
most admirable cast, but I must mention
the delightfully piquant drollery
of Miss <span class="smcap">Sydney Fairbrother</span> as <i>Mrs.
Micawber</i>, and the too-brief excellence
of Mr. <span class="smcap">Roy Byford</span> as the <i>Waiter</i> of
the "Golden Cross," and Mr. <span class="smcap">Gayer
Mackay</span> as <i>Littimer</i>. Mr. <span class="smcap">Quartermaine's</span>
<i>Uriah Heep</i>&mdash;a very careful
study&mdash;seemed perhaps too obviously
stamped from the start with the hallmark
of villany. Conversely the <i>Betsey
Trotwood</i> of Miss <span class="smcap">Agnes Thomas</span> appeared
to be lacking in austerity of mien.</p>

<p>One shared Mr. <span class="smcap">Nigel Playfair's</span>
enjoyment of the futility of <i>Mr. Dick</i>;
but this freakish figure, so typical of
<span class="smcap">Dickens</span>, seemed always a little out of
the picture.</p>

<p>Though <i>Mrs. Gummidge</i>, played with
a sound restraint by Miss <span class="smcap">Ada King</span>,
insisted from time to time upon the
fact that she was a "lone lorn creetur',"
we were spared a good many of the
author's reiterated tags, and I think it
was not till his friends had guaranteed
to lubricate his passage to the New
World that <i>Mr. Wilkins Micawber</i> so
much as alluded to his habitual expectation
of something "turning up."</p>

<p>The popularity of the production
promises to be exceptional, and with
good reason, apart from the high
quality of the performance. For with
its human tenderness, and the relief of
its gaiety, it offers just the right kind
of distraction to the strain of public
emotion in these times. And, though
its matter bears no relation to the
subject which absorbs our hearts, the
very name of <span class="smcap">Charles Dickens</span> makes
immediate appeal to that national spirit
which the War has reawakened.</p>

<h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.</i>)</p>

<p>This paragraph will, I hope, catch your eye in time to
be of use as a guide in the holiday fairy-tale traffic. But
at worst there are always birthdays or, for nursery gifts,
those even more apt occasions known as Nothing-in-particular
Days. (<i>Humpty-Dumpty</i>, you remember, a recognised
authority, used to call them un-birthdays.) Anyhow, if
you should be looking about for something applicable to Kit
or Ursula, you may take my word that you will find nothing
better than <i>The Dream Pedlar</i> (<span class="smcap">Simpkin, Marshall</span>).
The letterpress&mdash;I beg your pardon, I should have said the
"reading"&mdash;is by Lady <span class="smcap">Margaret Sackville</span>, who has
clearly a pretty taste in fairy matters, and the pictures are
by <span class="smcap">Florence Anderson</span> in colour, and <span class="smcap">Clara Shirley
Hayward</span> in black-and-white. I don't say that all these
are of equal merit, but the best of them are delightful.
Moreover, although in the modern sumptuous fashion the
colour plates are introduced on brown-paper mounts,
still they have the practical merit of being fixed, and
not merely gummed at one corner, a fashion that simply
results in litter for the nursery floor. The tales themselves
are wholly charming, and about quite the right
people, kings and woodcutters and dream-princesses and
goblins. Perhaps now and again Lady <span class="smcap">Margaret</span> falls to
the temptation of being a thought too clever with an aside,
so to speak, whispered in the ear of the reader-aloud. But
the wise child will forgive her this for the compelling
charm of her simplicities. For me, if I had a favourite in
the tales, it was perhaps <i>Martin's godmother</i>, "an attractive
old lady, short, with large fan-like ears, which she would
wave to and fro when amused." There is an enchanting
picture of her doing it. I have not yet known the nursery
where that picture would not soon bear the thumb-marks
of popularity.</p>

<hr />

<p>Not a single word could be conveniently omitted from
<i>Friends and Memories</i> (<span class="smcap">Arnold</span>), but I could easily spare
a great many of its notes of exclamation&mdash;nearly all
superfluous&mdash;for Miss <span class="smcap">Maude Valérie White's</span> style of
writing needs no such advertisement. And having got rid
of that grumble I feel at liberty to express, without restraint,
my profound admiration of the book and its author. Never,
then, has it been my good fortune to read so many pages
that are filled with what I can only call the fragrance of
life. Sorrows and troubles Miss <span class="smcap">White</span> has known in
abundance&mdash;one often sees her smiling through a veil of
tears&mdash;but she steadfastly refuses to dwell upon anything
but the joy of living, and the kindness of her many friends.
This splendid way of regarding the world is one of the
qualities that has made her welcome and more than welcome
wherever she goes; it is also the quality that gives
an almost unique distinction to her volume of reminiscences.
One can scarcely think of her as an eminent composer
whose songs have been heard throughout the world when
the gift, which she obviously values most and would herself
call "priceless," is that of being able to keep up a
cheerful end whatever happens. Her book, therefore, is
really both a tonic and a lesson, but it is a tonic that is as
delightful as good champagne, and it is a lesson that is full
of humour and of what is rarer than humour&mdash;good fun.
Even in her reticences Miss <span class="smcap">White</span> cannot save herself
from being amusing, for on her first page she refuses to tell
us her age, though afterwards she gives it away time and
again to anyone inquisitive enough to use a little arithmetic.
But she need have no fears, for she has the spirit of youth
which can laugh at figures and defy the passing years.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span></p>

<p>Must I believe that the life of anybody, even the
hardest worked and least attractive village girl, is as
devoid of exhilaration and good cheer as was that of
<i>Chrismas Hamlyn?</i> Maybe dismal events happen now
and then to individuals which make them wish, with reason,
that they were dead and had never been alive, and I will
admit that it was so with <i>Chrismas</i> at the moment when
her second lover proved to be entirely spurious and to
have pretended passion in order to steal a purse. But I am
asked to assume that, apart from and before this little
tragedy, she was necessarily in a state of gloom by reason
of the mere dulness and hardship of the existence of her
sort. This is a proposition which, notwithstanding Mrs.
<span class="smcap">Henry Dudeney's</span> skilful pleading, I am reluctant to
accept. I prefer to think that the girl found recreation
in everyday events, or at least in every other day events, of
her neighbourhood which would make no appeal to Mrs.
<span class="smcap">Dudeney</span> or myself; or, indeed, that the brooding over her
unhappy lot in general, and her first love failure in particular,
afforded some satisfaction for which credit has not
been allowed. Undoubtedly
the environment of the
<i>Hamlyns</i> is studied rather
from our view than from
their own, and by that
method of analysis a vast
amount of human misery
may be discovered which
does not always in fact
exist. Apart from that,
<i>What a Woman Wants</i>
(<span class="smcap">Heinemann</span>) is a convincing
study of the sordid side
of things; but I would like
to see the admirable gifts
of the authoress directed
to the emphasizing of the
merrier side of the same
sort of life, so that we
might compare the two
and form a more balanced
opinion.</p>

<hr />

<p><i>The Bed-Book of Happiness</i> is a "Colligation or Assemblage
of Cheerful Writings," colligated by Mr. <span class="smcap">Harold
Begbie</span>, and published by Messrs. <span class="smcap">Hodder and Stoughton</span>.
It is a second edition, entitled the Red-Cross Edition, and it
offers itself as an anodyne for the pain and boredom of
wounded heroes. Said heroes, of average British pattern,
would, I think, receive a nasty shock on reading the title
and might be tempted to thrust the volume privily away
without more ado. But they need do no such thing; it is
nothing like so bad as that. On the contrary it is stuffed
with most excellent matter for the perceptive, in doses not
long enough to tire and with sufficient variety to stimulate.
Old favourites from <span class="smcap">Hood</span> and <span class="smcap">Calverley</span>; an odd Ingoldsby
or two; whimsicality from <span class="smcap">Samuel Butler</span>; absurdities
from that other <span class="smcap">Samuel</span> (<span class="smcap">Clemens</span>); growls from that greatest
of the tribe, <span class="smcap">Johnson</span>; cheeriness from that best of poets
and schoolmasters, <span class="smcap">T. E. Brown</span>; a little <span class="smcap">Sterne</span>, a little
<span class="smcap">Dickens</span>, a little <span class="smcap">Thackeray</span>; <i>Percy Anecdotes</i> and
snippets from <span class="smcap">Gronow</span>; translated excerpts from those
delightful allies, <span class="smcap">Daudet, Saint-Beuve, Anatole France</span>;
and so forth and on. Of course no two colligators of bed-books
could agree upon their choice, but I do think
Mr. <span class="smcap">Begbie</span> might have bagged a little from R. L. S. That
omission and the deplorable title are my chief grievances.
It is a sound point that there is no unwholesome invalidy
tone about this seasonable re-issue with additions.</p>

<p>Though I enjoyed <i>Broken Shackles</i> (<span class="smcap">Methuen</span>) in a mild
degree, I hardly think that Mr. <span class="smcap">John Oxenham</span> has here
given us of his best. So little do I think this that I am
the prey of a suspicion&mdash;probably quite unfounded&mdash;that the
tale is either early work, or has been hastily put together
since the beginning of August. Anyhow, it's about a young
man named <i>de Valle</i>, an officer in the Eastern Army of
France, who is married but lives apart from his wife. The
time is the winter of 1870, and when the great surrender
comes, and the army is forced over into Switzerland, <i>de
Valle</i> is so sick of military muddles that he determines to
settle down as a Swiss civilian and never go back any more.
This (fortune helping him) he is enabled to do. He changes
his name to <i>Duval</i>, and starts the simpler life with some
pleasant folk who run a saw-mill in the Brunnen Thal.
He even goes so far as to marry the maid of the mill.
Which was rash of him, since he was still legally tied to his
French wife, and (in fiction at least) the course of bigamy
never did run smooth. Inevitably, therefore, not only did
he encounter his wife again, coming out of the casino at
Interlaken (she too has not
been idle, having meanwhile
married a Russian
Prince), but the villain of
the story also saw them
both, and looked to make
a good thing by it. But
you know how quick and
deep the Aar runs at Interlaken?
<i>Duval</i> accordingly
pushed the inconvenient
blackmailer into the water,
and everyone, with this exception,
lived happy. The
real merit of the book lies
not in this improbable plot,
but in its moving chapters
upon a little treated phase
of the last Franco-German
fighting. These are well done.</p>

<hr />

<p>Many gentle readers will
be well pleased to hear that
<span class="smcap">Agnes</span> and <span class="smcap">Egerton Castle</span> are giving them more news of
that engaging heroine, <i>Lady Kilcroney</i>. True, in the new
book <i>Kitty</i> herself plays but a subordinate part, but as her
dainty mantle of insolence and charm appeals to have fallen
on the shoulders of a worthy successor no one need grumble
upon that score. The new book is called <i>The Ways of Miss
Barbara</i> (<span class="smcap">Smith Elder</span>), and I daresay that having said so
much I might spare myself the pains of telling precisely
what those ways were. Do you need to hear how <i>Mistress
Barbara</i> (who was a kind of eighteenth-century <i>Becky
Sharp</i> without the sting) was befriended by <i>Lady Kitty</i>
and her susceptible lord? How the noble carriage was
waylaid on its journey from Paris to the coast? How the
highwayman was eventually brought to hook by the wiles
of <i>Barbara</i>, who in the long run marries a duke, and is left
preparing for permanent prosperity? Whether this last
expectation will be fulfilled without preliminary troubles I
take leave to doubt. Indeed, the situation as regards
<i>Barbara</i> and her ducal spouse is left so full of intriguing
possibilities that I could not but suspect those clever
campaigners, the <span class="smcap">Egerton Castles</span>, of having artfully
arranged it as a kind of concrete foundation from which
to attack the public sympathy later on. This is as may be.
Meanwhile here is a pleasantly sparkling comedy with
which, I vow, you are like to find yourself vastly well
pleased.</p>
